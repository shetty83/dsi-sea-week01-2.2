## Introduction

In this lab, we're going to practice writing simple functions.

#### Requirements

- Write a function with one argument. Find the area of a square.
- Write a function with two arguments. Find the area of a rectangle.
- Write a function with three arguments. Find the surface area of cuboid.

**Bonus:**
- Write a function to find the Max of three numbers.

- Write a function to sum all the numbers in a list.
Sample List : (8, 2, 3, 0, 7)
Expected Output : 20

- Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list. 
Sample List : (8, 2, 3, -1, 7)
Expected Output : -336

- Write a function to reverse a string. 
Sample String : "1234abcd"
Expected Output : "dcba4321"

- Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number (non-negative integer). The function accept the number as a argument.

- Write a function to check whether a number is in a given range. 

- Write an function that accepts a string and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters. 
Sample String : 'The quick Brow Fox'
Expected Output :
No. of Upper case characters : 3
No. of Lower case Characters : 12

- Write an function that takes a list and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list. 
  Sample List : [1,2,3,3,3,3,4,5]
  Unique List : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

- Write a function that takes a number as a parameter and check the number is prime or not. 
  Note : A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 and that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

- Write a function to print the even numbers from a given list. 
Sample List : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Expected Result : [2, 4, 6, 8]
